# ai-utils
- Storage for scripts and widgets for AI model trainin

tools I've created for managing datasets, data within those datasets

Most, if notall, these tools are or began to be used directly in a Linux cli, 
Some have web based counterparts, or always inteded to be,i.e., manually describing images for training ocr,captcha.

I use bits and pieces of code from other sources, I try to give proper credit to those who wrote. 


Whether I not their actial code is in here, I gained great knowledge and understanding from their efforts, 
so huge thanks to these folks.
